A simple app to test out form of data structure that can count a large number of string tokens

Motivation
----------
The problem is from:

> Design and describe a system/application that will most efficiently produce a report of the top 1 million Google search requests. You are given:
>
>    You are given 12 servers to work with. They are all dual-processor machines with 4Gb of RAM, 4x400GB hard drives and networked together.(Basically, nothing more than high-end PC's)
>    The log data has already been cleaned for you. It consists of 100 Billion log lines, broken down into 12 320 GB files of 40-byte search terms per line.
>    You can use only custom written applications or available free open-source software.
>

so it set out to write a quick test app that would be able to encode and count search terms as they were read in, in an efficient manner
